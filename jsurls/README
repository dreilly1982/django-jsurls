Usage (in js code)

>>> dj_jsurls.foo_named_url_path(13);
"/foo_named_urls/13/


This borrows from the ideas used in toretore/javescript_routes. I used javascript_routes 
extensively while I was coding in ROR. Now that I'm coding Django again, I decided to port it over.

Requires jquery.js and underscore.js (however, it would be pretty easy to hack into any js framework)

It is packaged as a plugable app; put it on your python path and add it to your INSTALLED_APPS

Cheers,
Stephen
