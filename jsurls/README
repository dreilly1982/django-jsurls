(in ./urls.py)
from jsurls.urls import jsurls_urlpatterns
urlpatterns += jsurls_urlpatterns()

(in base template)
<script type="text/javascript" src="{% get_jsurls_static_prefix %}js/jsurls.js"></script>

(in js code)
>>> jsurls.foo_named_url_path(13);
"/foo_named_urls/13/

to generate a static file for production (the route will only work in debug)
./manage.py generate_static_jsurls

This borrows from the ideas used in toretore/javescript_routes. I used javascript_routes 
extensively while I was coding in ROR. Now that I'm coding Django again, I decided to port it over.

Requires jquery.js and underscore.js (however, it would be pretty easy to hack into any js framework)

It is packaged as a plugable app; put it on your python path and add it to your INSTALLED_APPS

Cheers,
Stephen
